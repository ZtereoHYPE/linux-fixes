# linux-fixes
A little repo of various (hacky) fixes and patches that I apply to my linux install to make it work better :)

### I am currently using an Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 2022 (GA402RJ), so some of these might be tuned to fix that.

## TODO: (issues that I haven't tackled yet)
- [VRR on AMD dropping cursor updates](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2186)
- YouTube / VP9 playback still being icky. No biggie, tapping left and right arrow to fast forward and back fixes it for the whole video. but still.
- [Sleep being broken..](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/3132#note_2335870)
